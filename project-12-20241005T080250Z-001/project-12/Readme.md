# Parking Space Rental Smart Contract

## Vision

The Parking Space Rental project aims to create a decentralized platform where individuals can list and rent parking spaces in an efficient, trustless manner. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform enables parking space owners to monetize their assets while providing drivers with convenient and transparent rental options.

## Features

- **List Parking Space**: Parking space owners can list their available parking spaces, specifying the location and rental price.
- **Rent Parking Space**: Users can rent parking spaces directly from owners, ensuring the space is reserved for their use.
- **Transparent Availability**: Parking space availability and rental status are stored transparently on the blockchain, allowing users to easily see what is available for rent.

## Contract Address

- **Network**: Aptos Mainnet/Testnet
- **Contract Address**: `0x9a44bccaffd747a8cbd4e8c5a7da8c5f44903ea26d3aa129c0784fff80f6fe23` (Replace with the actual contract address once deployed)

## How It Works

1. **List Parking Space**:

   - Owners call the `list_space` function to list their parking space.
   - The function takes the parking location and rental price as parameters and stores this information on the blockchain.

2. **Rent Parking Space**:
   - Renters can call the `rent_space` function to rent an available parking space.
   - The contract checks if the parking space is available and updates its status, marking it as rented.

## Future Scope

- **Payment Integration**: Integrate on-chain payment handling to facilitate rental payments from renters to parking space owners.
- **Rental Duration and Automatic Availability**: Add support for specifying rental durations and automatically make the parking space available once the rental period ends.
- **Booking System**: Implement a booking system to allow users to reserve parking spaces for future use.
- **Rating and Review**: Allow renters to rate parking spaces and provide reviews, helping others make informed decisions.
- **Security Deposits**: Introduce a security deposit feature to ensure that users comply with the terms of the rental, such as returning the space on time.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies for the Aptos blockchain.
- Deploy the contract using your preferred deployment tool.
- Once deployed, users can list parking spaces and rent them through the smart contract functions.
